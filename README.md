## Prespectives

Always sluth for yourself, & try to go to source as much as possible.

'Stanford researchers calculated 2.5-4.2% of the county’s residents were infected as of early April. [so] Covid-19 is drastically more widespread than local swab testing suggests: 50-85x,.. consequently lowers the disease’s estimated fatality rate, driving it from ~1% to just 0.12-0.2%... death rate from the flu is about 0.1%.'
